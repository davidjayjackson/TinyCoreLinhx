# There is no need to force variables to be global, if they are used only in

# The types of workspaces are automatically determined by the properties of the

workspace 1 output *

# Each workspace is assigned to an output. This makes it possible to use
# workspace-specific configs for each monitor.

# To assign a specific workspace to a specific output:
#workspace 1 output DP-1

# To change the number of workspaces, you need to edit this in two places:
# here, and in the i3bar config file.

# It is important to keep the following line intact, since i3bar requires it to
# function properly.
